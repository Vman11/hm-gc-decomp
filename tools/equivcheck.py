"""Register-equivalence check of the built main.dol against the original.

Policy (2026-11-11): a function whose only difference from the original is WHICH
registers hold values counts as matched. Such functions are listed in
config/<version>/regequiv.txt and this script is the safety net that replaces the
plain sha1 check:

  a) both DOLs have the same size and section table, and every byte outside .text
     is identical, except register-number fields of C++ exception actions in the
     extab entries of listed functions (rule e);
  b) every differing .text word lies inside a function listed in regequiv.txt;
  c) in each such function every instruction pair has the same opcode and the same
     non-register fields (immediates, displacements, branch targets, condition bits);
  d) the register fields are explained by a renaming of LIVE RANGES. Both versions
     are analysed over the control-flow graph of the original (branches, and bctr
     through the original's jump tables): for every register the set of definitions
     that can reach each instruction is computed, where a definition is an
     (instruction, operand) position, the value a register has at function entry,
     or the write a call / an implicit result (cr0 of a record form, lmw, ...)
     makes. The function passes when
       - every register operand that is read is reached by exactly the same set of
         definition positions in both versions, and by the same register number
         when one of them is an entry value, a call result or an implicit write.
         So a value may sit in r29 in one region and in r30 in another, and two
         values that are live at the same time can never share a register in ours
         (the clobbered one would be reached by a different definition);
       - the two source operands of add, addc, adde, and, or, xor, nand, nor, eqv,
         mullw, mulhw(u), fadd(s), fmul(s) and the multiplicands of f(n)madd/f(n)msub
         may be exchanged (for the float ones this ignores which NaN payload is
         propagated when both operands are NaN);
       - at every call: r1, r2, r13, every argument register (r3-r10, f1-f8) written
         in the same basic block before the call, and every volatile register the
         callee may read (its live-in set over the whole original program;
         r3-r10, f1-f8, cr1 for indirect or undecodable callees) hold the same
         definitions in the same register number;
       - at every return: r3, r4, f1, every callee-saved register, r1, r2, r13 and
         any volatile register that some caller reads after the call do;
       - implicitly used registers (CR logic, mfcr, stmw/lmw ranges) do.
     Copy forwarding (second try, only for a function that failed without it): a plain
     copy (mr / ori rA,rS,0 / fmr) is not a definition site, the copy holds the sites of
     its source. So `addi r3,..; mr r31,r3` and `addi r31,..; mr r3,r31` are the same
     (the value reaches r3 and r31 from the addi in both). When a site executes again,
     every register still holding its earlier value is marked stale and is never
     accepted this way; entry values and call results are not forwarded either.
     A value that is live across a call therefore has to be in a callee-saved
     register in ours as well, and results are read from the ABI registers.
     Assumptions: a callee does not interpret the caller's callee-saved registers
     (it only saves and restores them); a volatile register other than r3/r4/f1
     that a call leaves behind matters only when the caller reads it with its own
     instructions (for those, and for r3/r4/f1, a call is transparent for the
     registers the callee can return unchanged). Functions with an unresolved bctr,
     a call into the middle of another function, or unreachable code that differs
     are rejected, as is anything the decoder does not know.
  e) extab (since 2026-11-11, wUM): an exception action that destroys / deletes an object
     held in a register names that register (flag 0x80 on the first u16 operand, 0x40 on the
     second). The extab entry of a listed function may differ from the original ONLY in the
     u16 register operand of a DELETEPOINTER (0x0A) or DELETEPOINTERCOND (0x0B) action
     (decoded from the entry's PC ranges and action chains; an entry that is not fully
     understood must be byte-identical), and only if at every call inside the PC ranges that
     use the action the register in ours holds exactly the definitions (same(...) of rule d)
     the original's register holds there. The same equality is required for every other
     register operand of the function's actions even when it is unchanged. Everything else
     in extab and all of extabindex stays byte-identical.
  f) schedule (experimental, branch sched-equiv, wYA 2026-11-12): a function listed in
     config/<version>/schedequiv.txt may also have its instructions in a different order
     inside basic blocks, as long as our order only exchanges instructions that do not
     depend on each other (registers incl. CR/XER[CA]/FPSCR, memory unless provably
     disjoint; branches, calls, mtspr/mfspr, cache/sync instructions are barriers) and the
     function passes rule d) once our instructions are put back into the original order.
     See the comment above sched_info() for the exact rules.
  --strict uses the first version of rule d) instead: ONE renaming for the whole
     function (a bijection orig -> ours, separately for GPRs, FPRs and CR fields)
     that is the identity on every register visible across an ABI boundary:
       - r0, r1, r2, r13;
       - registers live at function entry (parameters; saving a callee-saved
         register to the stack frame is not counted as a read);
       - registers a callee may read at each call: the callee's own live-in set
         (computed over the whole original program; indirect/unknown callees read
         r3-r10, f1-f8, cr1; callee-saved registers the callee saves in its own
         frame are not inputs) plus every argument register written in the same basic
         block before the call;
       - r3/r4/f1 if anything may read them after a call before they are rewritten
         (results), and any other volatile register this function itself reads
         after a call;
       - r3 / f1 if the function writes them at all (results; also r4 when some
         caller reads r4 after calling the function);
       - registers used implicitly (cr0/cr1 of record forms, CR logic, mfcr/mtcrf);
     and it keeps volatile registers volatile, callee-saved registers callee-saved
     and the register range of stmw/lmw closed.
  Anything the decoder does not know is rejected.

Usage:
  python3 tools/equivcheck.py                 check build/<v>/main.dol (exit 1 on violation)
  python3 tools/equivcheck.py --strict ...    same, with the whole-function renaming rule
  python3 tools/equivcheck.py --selftest      the listed functions must pass, corrupted copies must fail
  python3 tools/equivcheck.py --list U ...    would these pass? U is a unit (auto/text_8002BDD4),
                                              unit:fn or a function name; compares
                                              build/<v>/src/<unit>.o with build/<v>/obj/<unit>.o
                                              and the original DOL, without linking.
Only the Python standard library is needed.

# ---- schedule equivalence (experimental, branch sched-equiv) ---------------
#
# f) A function listed in config/<version>/schedequiv.txt may, in addition to rule d), have
#    its instructions in a different ORDER inside basic blocks. check_sched() looks for a
#    permutation of our instructions, block by block (the blocks of the original; every
#    branch, call and return keeps its position), such that
#      1. the permuted function passes rule d) against the original (same instructions at
#         the same positions up to live-range renaming, ABI rules at calls and returns), and
#      2. the permutation only exchanges instructions of OURS that do not depend on each
#         other, i.e. our order and the permuted order are two topological orders of the
#         dependency graph of our block (sched_dag), built from the concrete registers:
#         - registers (GPR, FPR, CR fields, XER[CA], FPSCR class/condition bits): a read
#           stays after the write it sees and before the next write; a write whose value
#           is read (or is the last one in the block) stays after every earlier write;
#         - memory: a store stays ordered with every other load/store unless both use the
#           same base register holding the same value (no write to it in between) with
#           non-overlapping [off, off+size) (this covers two different stack slots);
#           indexed accesses never count as disjoint. In a function that builds a
#           hardware address (lis 0xCC00/0xCD00/0xE000) loads keep their order too;
#         - barriers keep their position and nothing crosses them: branches, calls,
#           returns, mtspr/mfspr (mflr, mtctr, ...), mfmsr/mtmsr, mftb, mfcr/mtcrf, CR
#           logic, isync/sync, the cache instructions, lmw/stmw, OE forms, mffs/mtfsf/
#           mtfsb, record forms of float instructions.
#    Two orders of the same dependency graph compute the same registers and memory, and
#    the permuted function is the original up to rule d), so ours is equivalent.
